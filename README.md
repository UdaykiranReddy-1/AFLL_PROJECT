# AFLL_PROJECT
This code uses python modules yacc and lex to validate the syntax of javascript if-else loop by writing context-free grammar(belongs to subject AFLL).
By learning the usage of the modules in validating the syntax of if-else loop in javascript, one can implement the learnt logic to validate the syntax of any language ,
using appropriate context-free grammar for evaluation.
